I"‘<p>I had an opportunity to stay &amp; shoot this recently renovated Riad (villa) in the heart of the old medina in Marrakech, Morocco. Similar to the villa I stayed &amp; shot in Seville, the attention to detail here made it so photogenic. The light in Morocco is famous in the photography world &amp; the way the architect has bought light into the building made shooting it a real pleasure.Â Â </p>
