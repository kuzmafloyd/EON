I"Ï<p>I suppose what has drawn me to this, has been the beauty of creating something that can both simultaneously be your own and open to millions of people around the world, where your expression is endless and everlasting. The beauty of the technological age, the internet, in particular, is just that, it‚Äôs everlasting and somewhat indestructible (at least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm told by my forever skeptical aging parents). What we as individuals put out there, whether negative or positive, is helping us shape the world for future generations and should be embraced, not hidden away.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been lucky enough to travel to over 30 countries, work in exotic locations around the world, help build two successful businesses and have a network of supportive family and friends. Up until now, that‚Äôs been all I‚Äôve ever needed &amp; for some, it‚Äôs everything they‚Äôve ever dreamt of‚Ä¶ however, for me, even with all of this, I‚Äôve realized that something has been missing, a place of expression, a place to tell a story. So here it is, welcome to Eyes of a Nomad, my little slice of the internet to express my love for travel, photography and our planet and hopefully inspire more people, no matter who they are, to do the same at some level. I want to take all that I‚Äôve discovered, learned and experienced and share it with the world, with you.</p>

<p>To be honest I‚Äôm not sure what this blog will become, I‚Äôm a big believer in letting the universe help shape our lives (it seems the harder we push against it, the harder it pushes back) so I‚Äôm not going to make any grand promises, but what I will promise is to provide my honest, down-to-earth views and opinions and just be me. I‚Äôm also not into the whole blog about what I ate for lunch business (all the power to you guys), I want to tell a story, take you on an adventure, show you the world. So expect to see beautiful places I‚Äôve visited, read stories of my crazy adventures and have a peak into my quest to expand my photography beyond just a side passion and into a career.</p>

<p>With this in mind I have to give you some pre-warning, I‚Äôve never been much of a poet by any means and people that know me well, could probably label me with dyslexia, so I‚Äôll stick to what I feel comfortable with (thank god for Grammarly!) and tell this story predominantly through photography and keep the words short!</p>

<p>I learned to enjoy photography from a young age, with my dad being very keen on it (and very good I might add) and would be amazingly patient while I pressed every button on his camera while he taught me the basics, but it wasn‚Äôt until my first trip to South America that it morphed into a passion. Since then I‚Äôve continued to push my knowledge of photography in the best way I know how - learn by doing, with a hell of a lot of trial and error! The more I do it, the more my old dreams of fast expensive cars and pretty girls are replaced with ones of photography &amp; travel. You know how we all have that one dream that no matter what‚Äôs going on around us, it sticks in your mind? For me that dream is to travel the world, meet all walks of life and take photos that capture not only the beautiful side of life but also the side that can be terrifying and sad. I‚Äôm not quite there yet and there is still a hell of a lot of learning to do and like the famous Victor Kiam (to be honest, not that famous) once said, ‚Äúeven if you fall on your face, you‚Äôre still moving forward‚Äù- it may not be the most profound quote going around, but it‚Äôs positive all the same and keeps me going haha.</p>

<p>Before I started to write this post, I did a quick google search on what my first post should be about. It gave me a list of what should and shouldn‚Äôt be included and I think I‚Äôve covered most of them. However, one of the points that resonated with me most, was to encourage you guys to get involved. That could be through asking me questions and suggesting topics for me to cover but also and most importantly, to challenge me. I believe that there are a million ways to skin a cat- by challenging each other, we learn faster and build off our differing opinions, so don‚Äôt hold back!</p>

<p>So there you go, that‚Äôs a very small snippet of who I am and what to expect! Hopefully, you want to see and learn more about who I am and what I‚Äôm doing‚Ä¶ If so, read on and enjoy the journey through the Eyes of a Nomad.</p>
