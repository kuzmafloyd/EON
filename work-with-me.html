    <h1> Work with me </h1>
    <p> I'm always interested in collaborations, partnerships, and opportunities whether travel or photography/videography related. I've got all my own professional equipment, including a Canon 5D MkIV with a range of high-end professional lenses, a GoPro 4 Hero Black with 3-axis electronic stabilizer and Mavic Pro drone, among other things. Photography is my passion, and I do it because I love it! As a result, I take enormous pride in my work, so let me know what you are looking for, and hopefully we can make some incredible photos together!</p>
