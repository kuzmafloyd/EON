I"ù<p>What started out on a quest to find some waves down on the Mornington Peninsular, turned into a fun day at one of its more hidden beaches. Ive dreamed of taking pictures here since my first visit many years ago. I love that it stays a little hidden from the throb of tourists that decend on the Mornington Peninsular every summer, as it hasnt changed a bit. The long grass, black pebble beach and towering amphitheater-like cliffs make it one of the most stunning places just outside of Melbourne.</p>
