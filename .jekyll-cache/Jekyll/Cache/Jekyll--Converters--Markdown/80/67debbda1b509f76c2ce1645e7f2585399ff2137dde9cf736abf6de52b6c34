I"â<p>Joshua District is a group of villas west of Canggu built entirely from recycled shipping containers. Ive been lucky enough to be invited time and again to shoot this amazing series of villas. I have always been interested in the concept of shipping container houses &amp; am constantly blown away by just how incredible these villas are, a true testament to the vision of the guys at Joshua District. They wanted me to showcase the villa through curated lifestyle photos.Â </p>
