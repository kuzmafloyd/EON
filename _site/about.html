<!-- OLD ABOUT SECTION
<h3>A entrepreneur, a traveller, a photographer - with a love for adventure in this big wide world</h3>
<p>Photography has always been an passion in my life, starting when I was a toddler and would grab my father’s camera, emptying his entire roll of film aimlessly in a few short minutes. But it wasn’t until I began to travel the world that my love for capturing a fraction of a second, something breathtakingly beautiful or a little crazy became an obsession. I would never classify myself as a "photographer” but more as someone who simply wants to capture the beauty of the ever-changing world for others to see.</p>
<span class="dropdown-section"><button class="about-button">Read More</button>
  <div class="dropdown-content">
    <p>The first time I solo-traveled was at the ripe age of 12, crossing the Australian border to visit a friend on the island nation of Fiji. With my disposable camera in hand, I snapped as many photos as I possibly could. It was a gigantic adventure and sparked my desire to travel as much as my life, and piggy bank, would allow. And, I haven’t let go of my camera since.</p>
    <p>My travels have brought me to 22 countries, introduced me to amazing people and even inspired me to co-found an international business <a href="http://www.instituteofcode.com/"> (The Instutute of Code)</a>, based in the beautiful country of Bali. You will inevitably see a lot of photos from this incredible island as I explore more of it and begin to call it my second home.</p> -->

  <h1> About Me </h1>
  <h2 class="small-h2"> Eyes of a Nomad  |  Emilio Kuzma-Floyd </h2>
  <p> Hi everyone, my name is Emilio, I'm a 27-year-old Australian guy spending all of my free time exploring beautiful Bali. So I've never written a blog before, but after what has seemingly been a quasi-quarter life crisis or just a Gen x trying to navigate the chaos that is the millennial age (I'm yet to figure out which of the two it is), I've decided to give it a crack! </p>

  <figure><img src='/images/about/cali.jpg' alt='Emile Kuzma Floyd'><figcaption>CALIFORNIA | Driving one of my favorite roads in the world - State Route 1</figcaption></figure>

  <p>I suppose what has drawn me to this, has been the beauty of creating something that can both simultaneously be your own and open to millions of people around the world, where your expression is endless and everlasting. The beauty of the technological age, the internet, in particular, is just that, it’s everlasting and somewhat indestructible (at least that’s what I’m told by my forever skeptical aging parents). What we as individuals put out there, whether negative or positive, is helping us shape the world for future generations and should be embraced, not hidden away.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/about/patagonia-3.jpg" alt="Patagonia in South America" /><figcaption>CHILE | Torres del Paine - Standing in front of an iceberg graveyard with some of the most dramtic scenery as a backdrop.</figcaption></figure>

  <p>I’ve been lucky enough to travel to over 30 countries, work in exotic locations around the world, help build two successful businesses and have a network of supportive family and friends. Up until now, that’s been all I’ve ever needed &amp; for some, it’s everything they’ve ever dreamt of… however, for me, even with all of this, I’ve realized that something has been missing, a place of expression, a place to tell a story. So here it is, welcome to Eyes of a Nomad, my little slice of the internet to express my love for travel, photography and our planet and hopefully inspire more people, no matter who they are, to do the same at some level. I want to take all that I’ve discovered, learned and experienced and share it with the world, with you.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/about/chicago.jpg" alt="Chicago in the United States of America" /><figcaption>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA | The Chicago Bean - go to the midwest in winter, they said, it wont be that cold, they said... </figcaption></figure>

  <p>To be honest I’m not sure what this blog will become, I’m a big believer in letting the universe help shape our lives (it seems the harder we push against it, the harder it pushes back) so I’m not going to make any grand promises, but what I will promise is to provide my honest, down-to-earth views and opinions and just be me. I’m also not into the whole blog about what I ate for lunch business (all the power to you guys), I want to tell a story, take you on an adventure, show you the world. So expect to see beautiful places I’ve visited, read stories of my crazy adventures and have a peak into my quest to expand my photography beyond just a side passion and into a career.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/about/ecuador.jpg" alt="Ecuador" /><figcaption>ECUADOR | Riding dirtbikes in the small town of Banõs, my second time there and still managed to get lost in paradise... which i was more than happy with!</figcaption></figure>

  <p>With this in mind I have to give you some pre-warning, I’ve never been much of a poet by any means and people that know me well, could probably label me with dyslexia, so I’ll stick to what I feel comfortable with (thank god for Grammarly!) and tell this story predominantly through photography and keep the words short!</p>

<figure><img src="/images/about/antigua.jpg" alt="joshua tree national park" /><figcaption>GUATEMALA | That face all photographers pull... mind you with LCDs replacing view-finders, maybe its a thing of the past!</figcaption></figure>

  <p>I learned to enjoy photography from a young age, with my dad being very keen on it (and very good I might add) and would be amazingly patient while I pressed every button on his camera while he taught me the basics, but it wasn’t until my first trip to South America that it morphed into a passion. Since then I’ve continued to push my knowledge of photography in the best way I know how - learn by doing, with a hell of a lot of trial and error! The more I do it, the more my old dreams of fast expensive cars and pretty girls are replaced with ones of photography &amp; travel. You know how we all have that one dream that no matter what’s going on around us, it sticks in your mind? For me that dream is to travel the world, meet all walks of life and take photos that capture not only the beautiful side of life but also the side that can be terrifying and sad. I’m not quite there yet and there is still a hell of a lot of learning to do and like the famous Victor Kiam (to be honest, not that famous) once said, “even if you fall on your face, you’re still moving forward”- it may not be the most profound quote going around, but it’s positive all the same and keeps me going haha.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/about/mexico.jpg" alt="joshua tree national park" /><figcaption>MEXICO | When you charter a private yacht for your team to celebrate and things get messy... I have no idea where Dan got the pineapple from?!</figcaption></figure>

  <p>Before I started to write this post, I did a quick google search on what my first post should be about. It gave me a list of what should and shouldn’t be included and I think I’ve covered most of them. However, one of the points that resonated with me most, was to encourage you guys to get involved. That could be through asking me questions and suggesting topics for me to cover but also and most importantly, to challenge me. I believe that there are a million ways to skin a cat- by challenging each other, we learn faster and build off our differing opinions, so don’t hold back!</p>

  <p>So there you go, that’s a very small snippet of who I am and what to expect! Hopefully, you want to see and learn more about who I am and what I’m doing… If so, read on and enjoy the journey through the Eyes of a Nomad.</p>
